slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 7711298 ON s37 CANCELLED AT 2023-04-20T16:48:11 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[56068,0],0] on node s37
  Remote daemon: [[56068,0],1] on node s38

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
