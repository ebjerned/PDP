slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 7827881 ON s5 CANCELLED AT 2023-05-05T22:35:52 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[39869,0],0] on node s5
  Remote daemon: [[39869,0],1] on node s8

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
