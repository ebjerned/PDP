slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 7934128 ON s48 CANCELLED AT 2023-06-08T15:09:30 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[38285,0],0] on node s48
  Remote daemon: [[38285,0],1] on node s129

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
