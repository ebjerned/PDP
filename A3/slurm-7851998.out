slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 7851998 ON s34 CANCELLED AT 2023-05-10T11:20:35 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[31833,0],0] on node s34
  Remote daemon: [[31833,0],1] on node s44

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
